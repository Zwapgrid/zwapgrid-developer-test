## Overview

Zwapgrid exists to share data from various systems via a unified API. It is important for us that you understand and can demonstrate the fundamentals of interacting with APIs to send and receive data.

### The Test

For our technical test, the requirement is simple: _**Display a list of invoices from our test system: Test.1**_

### How?

We will provide access to our Client Portal, and you should:

1. Log in and set up an API Key: https://clients.zwapgrid.com/apikeys
